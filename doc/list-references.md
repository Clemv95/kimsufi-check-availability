# Disclaimer
**Be careful with this list! It may not be up-to-date!** For example they can upgrade the characteristics of a server and then change the reference to distinguish old and new servers having the same commercial name.

So if you use the script with an old reference, you will never get notified because Kimsufi doesn't sell this reference anymore.
